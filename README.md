# BYOD-chatbot-HoL

The lab "Bring your Own Data Chatbot" lab is utterly simple: 

1. Start a CML AMP with a RAG (Retreival augmented Generation) mechanism in it
2. Upload your own data to the Data directory
3. Re-populate the Vector Database with the contents of your own data
4. Chat away by asking questions to the texts that you have provided


The idea is that people who can show how easy it is to benefit from using RAG can become ambassadors in their organisation and start using the benefits of RAG-LLM.

Ideally, the lab environment should be running a couple of days after the lab to enable participants to show their results in their organisation
